      "text: \"<question>Analyze the sales data in the provided image \\'sales_chart.png\\'. It includes a table of sales amounts and volumes by salesperson, along with a corresponding bar and line chart.\\n\\nAnswer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.\\n\\n1. How many salespeople have a sales amount over $500?\\n2. Which salesperson has the highest sales volume?\\n3. What\\'s the correlation between the sales amount and sales volume?\\n4. Draw a scatterplot of sales amount (x-axis) and sales volume (y-axis) along with a dotted red regression line through it.\\n   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `\\\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...\\\"` under 100,000 bytes.\\n</question>\\nI know nothing about data analytics. To solve my question, follow this exact process:\\n\\n### Step 1:\\nI will give you a question statement with possible data sources (URL, CSV, database, etc.).  \\nYour first task: generate code that extracts **basic info** about the data source:\\n- URL \u2192 Scrape and summarize tables, headings, and important structures. Keep summary under 100 tokens.\\n- CSV/Excel \u2192 Return first 3 rows.\\n- Database \u2192 Show table names or schema preview.\\n- PDF/Text/Image \u2192 Extract a small preview (not full content).\\n\\n### Step 2:\\nDownload or extract the required data and save it in uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325.\\n\\n### Step 3:\\nI will pass you the collected info from uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/metadata.txt.  \\nThen, generate code to solve the question fully and save the **final answer** in uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/result.txt (or result.json if the format is structured).\\n\\n### Step 4:\\nI will give you the content of uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/result.txt.  \\n- If correct \u2192 mark `run_this=0`.  \\n- If wrong \u2192 provide corrected code to recompute the answer.  \\n\\n### Error Handling:\\nIf I give you an error message:\\n- Fix the exact issue and return corrected code.\\n- If the error repeats, generate entirely new code.\\n\\n### Output Format:\\nYou must always answer in **valid JSON** like this:\\n{\\n    \\\"code\\\": \\\"<python_code_here>\\\",\\n    \\\"libraries\\\": [\\\"list\\\", \\\"of\\\", \\\"external_libraries\\\"],\\n    \\\"run_this\\\": 1 or 0\\n}\\n\\n### Additional Rules:\\n- Save extracted info into uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/metadata.txt (append mode).  \\n- Save final answers in uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/result.txt (or uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/result.json if structured).  \\n- Always prepend file access with uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/filename.  \\n- Use only necessary pip-installable external libraries.  \\n\\nExample Output: if asked to send a JSON like this:\\n[\\\"What is the meadian of data\\\", \\\"What is mean\\\", \\\"provide base64 image\\\"]\\n\\nThen, send result like this:\\n\\n[20, 25, \\\"base64 image  url here\\\"]\\nI mean don\\'t send answers like key:answer, unless it is specified.\\n- All the uploaded files will be in the folder uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325. You can access them like this uploads/794472ee-6598-4fd2-9a45-ccf4a37fc325/filename.\\n\"\n"
